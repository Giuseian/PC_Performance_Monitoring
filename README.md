# Statistics: Performance Monitoring

Copyright © 2022 Alessio Borgi

PROJECT SCOPE: Main PC Components Analysis through Statistics and ML Techniques.

PROJECT RESULTS:
• Data collection (CPU, Memory, Physical Disk, Cache, and Battery) through the Windows' "Performance Monitoring" application over multiple PCs.
• Clustering Techniques application (K-Means Clustering, K-Means++, GMM, K-Means Elkan Algorithm) classifying the data collected either idle or working. 
• By-Hand K-Means and K-Means++ implementation. 
• Elbow Method, Silhouette Coefficient, and AIC & BIC evaluation Criteria determining the best number of clusters.
• Best Algorithm  choice based on Accuracy and Time Performances.
• Best PC choice based on Time Performances.
• Average Page Faults measurements (using Non-Parametric and Parametric Bootstrap).
• Anova-one-way-Test for Page and Cache Faults comparison test. 
• Pairwise T-Test for finding similar Pcs’ behaviours.
• Linear Regression Application to determine "%Disk Time" vs "Average Disk Write Queue Length", and "Data Maps/Sec" vs "Copy Reads/Sec" relationships.
• Highly Potential Influence points individuation with Leverage and Cook's Distance Techniques.
